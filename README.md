# Crammer-solver
Purpose:
I programed this small code to solve any matrix inputed using Crammer method.

    Files: 
    a) CramerMain.c: this file has the code ready to compile. when compiled it will be asking for a matrix size (only for square matrix) and then you will have to input number by number until the matrix is filled
    b) CramerEjecut.exe: This file is the excecutable of the code. If you don't feel safe doing it you can always check the code and the compile it yourself
    c) diagramaEstadosFinitosCrammer.jpg: is a FSD (finite state diagram) to show the basic logic of the code.
    d) explicacion cramer.docx: Is a word file to explain with math the basic logic of crammer.

This code was made by Edward Nicolas Duarte Valencia, and the function of the determinant was made by engiener Juan Carlos Giraldo (jcgiraldo@javeriana.edu.co)
